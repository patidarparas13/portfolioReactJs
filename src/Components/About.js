                    I have been programming websites for the last one year and I worked on different Web Technologies. I also spent time with Machine Learning, to explore new models and frameworks to solve real-world complex tasks that were tough with the software engineering aspect. I also contribute to the community a lot in various ways like, organizing events or helping people to get started with the technologies.
